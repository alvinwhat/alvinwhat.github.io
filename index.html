                        Dear Alvin, <br>

                        <br> I hope you like the watch. I've been thinking for a while what a good gift for you would be, now that you're starting college soon. <br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <br>
                        Headphones? Concert tickets? A journal? A GoPro? 101031094 packs of HiChew? Shampoo??? Blankets????? A jacket? Hm.. maybe a nice jacket..... nah.<br>
                    </p>

                    <p><br>
                        Even better: <b><a href="http://orientwatchusa.com/db08001w" target="blank">A classy motherfucking watch.</a></b><br>

                        <br> Having a watch is awesome: <br>

                            <ol>
                                <li class="shift-right">You look sophisticated</li>
                                <li class="shift-right">You can tell the time</li>
                            </ol>

                        <br> This is your watch. It's made by Orient, a top mechanical watch-making company based in Japan. It's stainless-steel with a rose gold tone, and I think it can match well with any kind of outfit: chill, serious, cool, whatever. It's waterproof up to 50 meters, which means you can shower or swim with it without worrying about it breaking (probably better if you don't). And the really cool thing about this mechanical watch is that you can see the inner ticking on the face. Here's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZwq1KL4SD0">video</a> explaining how mechanical watches work. Most "common" watches nowadays are digital and run on electricity. Those electric ones are more easily calibrated to be kept accurate, but they're NOWHERE AS COOL AS YOUR WATCH. The amout of precision mechanics and design that goes into a device like this is insane. I think it's really cool to just have one on your wrist, telling you time the old-fashioned way.<br>

                        <br> Anyways, besides all that fancy-schmancy whatever, there's an even bigger reason I wanted to give you a watch. It's kind of romantic and dumb, but it's the most literal and practical symbolization I could think of, and I really want you to think about it:<br>

                        <br>The concept of <b>time</b>.<br>

                        <br>In four years, you're not going to remember how Sydney made you feel like your emotions for her weren't real. It'll be there in your memories, but
                        it'll be a blur.</br>

                        <br>You won't remember how Mom and Dad made you do a lot of things you didn't want to do, like take piano, learn Go, play golf, and apply to college.</br>

                        <br>What will you remember then? You'll remember the fun times you had with you friends, dicking around doing "dumb" things that made you feel like yourself.</br>

                        <br>You'll remember how hard you worked to be a top swimmer in high school.</br>

                        <br>You'll remember trying new things, losing a sense of yourself, and rebuilding that throughout your college life.</br>

                        <br>What's the difference between the things that you'll remember and the things that you don't? Well.. you receive one, and give the other.</br>

                        <br>You're going into college soon, and it'll be a totally new time of your life. People will praise you. People will hate you. People will fight you. People will love you. You'll have great teachers and horrible teachers. The list goes on. Allowing these things to affect you uncontrollably means you're <b>wasting your time</b>.These are the things that the world <b>gives to you</b>.</br>

                        <br>The only things that you have complete control over, are how you treat others, how you fight for the things you believe in,
                        and <b>how you spend your time</b>. These are the things that <b>you give</b> to the world.</br>

                        <br>For example. What if you don't like what your studying? 1. Work harder and study it better so that you're "good" at it, or 2. Think about what you like and study that instead. Life is much better if you feel like you have control over your time, rather than feeling like your time is consumed by the things around you.</br>

                        <br>What if you don't like your friends? Take a second to think about why you don't like your friends. Why do you enjoy spending time with them? Why can't you go out and meet new people? Is there a close friend you don't know how to solve a problem with? Can you talk it out with them? You control your relationships. You control how you interact with others and how you would like others to interact with you.</br>

                        <br>Elon Musk is able to do the things he does because 1. he reads books, 2. he talks to people to learn things from them, and 3. he puts hours and hours into things that interest him to see if he can make his ideas become reality. He's efficeint with his time. Here's a really good article that I think you should read if you get a chance: <a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/11/the-cook-and-the-chef-musks-secret-sauce.html">Musk's Secret Sauce</a>. I admire him, but because I understand how he works in a way, I don't put him on a pedestal. I don't think the things he has done are out of my reach. I can do it too, if I am smart with my time.</br>

                        <br>Anyways, I'm rambling.</br>

                        <br>Take a moment to think about your life. What do you like? What do you fear? These are the things that define you. If you don't have an answer to either of those things, you are not living. You can't impact anyone else, if you don't care.</br>

                        <br>I love you so much, Alvin. After the times we had together growing up, playing Maplestory, making up the world of beebs and jakjak, fighting each other, going on boring road trips.. I only wish we had more time, to build things, learn things, explore things together.</br>

                        <br>Well, the best part is, we do :)</br>

                        <br>Happy Birthday.</br>
